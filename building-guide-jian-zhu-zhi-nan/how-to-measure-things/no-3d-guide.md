# No 3D Guide

Because China Lacks 3D models for buildings we can often face an issue where the base of the building is unclear and the roof is extremely off centre. This makes the use of [tpll.md](tpll.md "mention")more difficult.

## A Solution to the no 3D Problem.

For Basic buildings where the roof and the sides are perpendicular we can apply the following method. Where we tpll out the dimensions of the roof and move it to the base.

#### **1. Measure Roof Section**

**•** TPLL **** out the roof section ignoring that it's off centre - see [tpll.md](tpll.md "mention") for clear instruction.

• TPLL 3 Points out into Minecraft and connect them with //line.

• Mirror those Lines so the roof outline is completely Symmetrical by copy-pasting lines.

#### 2. Move the roof to match a Point on the base.

• TPLL to the corner of the base of the building.&#x20;

• TPLL in-game and place a block to represent where the base corner is.

• Use //cut to copy the roof outline, making sure you are standing on the roof corner that corresponds with the base corner in the above step.

• Use //paste -a to paste the roof section we just copied, standing on the block we placed to represent the corner of the base of the building.

• Okay! We are done. We now have a fairly accurate outline in the right spot.
