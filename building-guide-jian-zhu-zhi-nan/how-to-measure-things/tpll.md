# /TPLL

/TPLL is probably the most important command you need to master in order to build anything in this project. The /TPLL command enables you to teleport to an exact location in Minecraft by converting in-real-life coordinates to Minecraft coordinates in-game.\

Because China doesn't have 3d on Minecraft you will often see this:
