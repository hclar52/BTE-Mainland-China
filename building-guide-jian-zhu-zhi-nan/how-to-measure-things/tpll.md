# /TPLL

/TPLL is probably the most important command you need to master in order to build anything in this project. The /TPLL command enables you to teleport to an exact location in Minecraft by converting in-real-life coordinates to Minecraft coordinates in-game.\
\
For the sake of simplicity, we are building China to the coordinates of Google Maps Satelite view.

## How To Get Real Life Coordinates.

#### 1. Navigate To The Area Of Interest In Google Maps

• Head To [https://www.google.com/maps](https://www.google.com/maps) and find the location you are interested in, making sure you are in Satellite view.

#### 2. How To Get The Coordinates From Google Maps

• Right-click on the exact location you wish to locate and the coordinates should come up. \
• Left-click the numbers and they will be copied to your clipboard. \
• It is critical you be extremely accurate, where possible zoom in as much as you can to ensure you get exact coordinates.

#### 3. Teleport To The Location Using TPLL

• In-game type /TPLL then paste what is in your clipboard and click enter.\
• This will teleport you to that exact location in-game

#### 4. Mark The Point In-Game

• Place a block in the location you just teleported to in order to represent that point.

#### When TPLL isn't enough.

• Because China doesn't have 3d on Minecraft you will often see this:
