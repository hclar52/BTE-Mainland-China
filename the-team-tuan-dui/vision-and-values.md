## Our Values

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** Anyone can join our team! You just need this handbook, some building talent, time and a good attitude!
{% endhint %}

### Be Compassionate

We treat everyone we encounter with compassion, seeing the humanity behind their problems and experiences.

### Be Mindful

We adopt mindful working practices so that we can create safe spaces both in our working environment and in our products themselves.

### High-Quality Mindset

Unlike some teams in BTE we value quality over quantity. We believe it's better to build a few great structures over many average ones, hence we strive for highh quality builds. That's part of the reason we made this handbook! To provide you with a guide to improve your building ability and improve consistency across BTE Mainland China.
